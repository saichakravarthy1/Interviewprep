# Algorithm Implementations

This is just a collection of algorithms I wanted to implement in order to improve my understanding. They are NOT optimized and probably shouldn't be used in production code.


To run all unit tests:

    python3 -m unittest discover test


## quicksort

Recursive implementation of the quick sort algorithm.

To run tests:

    python3 quicksort.py


## mergesort

Recursive implementation of the merge sort algorithm.

To run tests:

    python3 mergesort.py


## hashtable

Simple hashtable implementation


## autoresizelist

A helper class used to implement the heap.

To run tests:

    python3 autoresizelist.py


## heap

Implementation of a heap.

To run tests:

    python3 heap.py


## nqueens

Backtracking solution to the n-queens problem (just finds the first one).

To run:

    python3 nqueens.py

To run tests:

    python3 -m unittest discover test --pattern="*nqueens*"


## combinatorics

Various combinatoric functions like permutations and combinations.

To run:

    python3 combinatorics.py

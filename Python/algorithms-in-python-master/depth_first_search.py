""" Depth-first search (recursive and iterative solutions)

This ignores the distance between the city data, and just cares about number of hops.

This implementation is admittedly tightly-coupled to my particular city_data data set
(to add clarity in understanding by making it tied to concrete data).

The city_data is a list of 28 large cities in the United States, with some considered
neighbors of the others. This would be the case in, say, a bus system which only
travels between major cities. Using the shortest path on this data outputs
the best path through these major cities.

The format of city_data is like this:

{   "Milwaukee, WI": {"Minneapolis, MN": 542093, "Chicago, IL": 148198},
    "Minneapolis, MN": {"Seattle, WA": 2665735, "Milwaukee, WI": 541660}, ... }

So the neighbors of a city node can be found like this: list(city_data["Milwaukee, WI"].keys())
